      <p style="margin: 20px 200px; text-align: justify;">Meaningless mock-up, mock turtle soup spilled on a mock turtle neck. Mach I Convertible copy. To kill a mockingbird, <br> you need only force it to read this copy. This is Meaningless filler. (Elvis movies.) It is not meant to be a forum for value judgments nor a scholarly diatribe on how vi <br> rtue should be measured. The whole point here (if such a claim can be made in an admittedly pointless paragraph) is that this is dummy copy.  Real bullets explode with destructive intensity. Such is not the case with dummy bullets. In fact, they don't explode at all. Duds. Dull thuds. Dudley do-wrongs. And do-wrongs don't make a right. Why on <br> earth are you still reading this? Haven't you realized it's just dummy copy? How many times must you be reminded that it's really not meant to be read? You're only wasting precious time. But be that as it may, you've got to throw in a sh <br> ort paragraph from time to time. Here's a short paragraph.
